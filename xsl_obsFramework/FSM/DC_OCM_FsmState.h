/**
 * Sample FsmState application class. This FsmState models the OCM mode logic.
 * <p>
 * This is a stub class. It provides dummy implementations for some of the virtual
 * methods of its superclass. 
 * This class was automatically generated by an XSL program that processes the
 * XML-based <i>target application model</i>. The XSL program  
 * searches the application model for all "FsmState" elements
 * which have a "Custom" subelement that indicates that a custom FsmState
 * class must be created. For each such element a class header file is created.
 * The base class of the generated class is assumed to be the class in the
 * "type" attribute of the FsmState element. 
 * The information in the application model is used to decide which virtual methods
 * should be overridden.
 * @todo Modify the generator meta-component generateRecoveryAction to generate the code
 * that sets the class identifier and to treat the default attributes in the custom recovery action description.
 * @author Automatically Generated Class
 * @version 1.0
